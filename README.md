# A Docker container for Gremlin 3.2.5 with a demo graph

This repository provides files to creates a container running a Gremlin server, [Gremlin Tinkerpop](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop) 3.2.5, with a TinkerGraph. The graph database is populated with data from a tree of life (tree of 35960 nodes and 35959 edges, see data section). 
The licence is Apache 2.0 for the code files and Creative Commons BY 3 for the data.


There are two releases of the this Gremlin server: a server using the Gremlin REST API on the `master` branch and a server using websocket on the `websocket` branch.


## How to run it

To build it, run the following command:
```
docker build -t gremlin-container . 
```
This will create a docker image with name `gremlin-container`.
The graph database is configured using the files in the `files/` folder.


You can then start the container using:
```
docker run -p 8182:8182 -it --name gremlin gremlin-container
```

The Gremlin server will serve resquests on port 8182. 

On startup, the server loads the graph from the file `files/treeoflife.graphml`. 
See the [TinkerGraph configuration section](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_configuration_2) for more details.

Alternatively, you can pull the image from DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph/)
```
docker pull bricaud/gremlin-server-with-demo-graph
```
.

## Data
The data provided in the graphml file `files/treeoflife.graphml` is a tree of life.
The original data can be found on the [Tree Of Life Project website](http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/downloadtree.html) as a xml file (old xml version of the tree). Details about the data can be found on the same page.

It is available at `files/tolskeletaldumpUTF8.xml` (converted to UTF8).


The data has been extracted and saved as a graphml file to be easily loaded by the gremlin server.
The python script performing this task is provided as a Jupyter notebook `files/tree_of_life_xml_tol.ipynb` (APACHE 2.0 licence).
